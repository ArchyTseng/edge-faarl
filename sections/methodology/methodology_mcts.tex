\subsection{LLM-Powered MCTS for Alpha Mining}
\label{sec:mcts}

Core from ref: Tree nodes, LLM prompts, backtesting eval, subtree avoidance. Why this? (Dynamic mining > static factors; efficiency on CPU). Pseudocode, implementations in src/mcts\_*.py (Weeks 3-4). Rationale: Balances exploration/exploitation without GPU.
