\section{Literature Review}

1,000-1,500 words: Survey alpha mining (e.g., GP, AlphaGen), LLM-MCTS (core ref: arXiv:
2505.11122â€”explain why it's foundational: tree search + LLM refinement + subtree avoidance for efficiency). Edge RL in finance (e.g., lightweight DRL on ARM). Gaps: No integrated pipelines for M1-like hardware. Why these refs? (They inspire but lack edge focus, justifying the extension).
