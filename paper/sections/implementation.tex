\section{Implementation Details and Reproducibility}
\label{sec:implement}

1,500-2,000 words: Full project structure breakdown (edgealpha\_faarl/ folders). Why this structure? (Modular for testing on single machine). Environment setup (e.g., conda on M1). Code walkthroughs with listings (e.g., main.py coordination). Testing: Why unit tests? (Ensure pipeline runs end-to-end without crashes). Reproducibility steps: Git clone, run scriptsâ€”justify for academic integrity. Hardware-specific tips: Profiling with Apple's Instruments tool.
